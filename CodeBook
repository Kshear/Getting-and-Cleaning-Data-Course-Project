Changes to original data (i.e. manipulation)

Names were updated to be more meaningful
  ACC was updated to Accelerometer
  Gyro was updated to Gyroscope
  BodyBody was simplfied to Body
  Mag was updated to Magnitude
  "f" was updated to Frequency
  "t" was updated to Time
  
  In the final dataset the mean and standard deviation for each activity and each participact was generated and labeled as either Mean or STD
  
  The follow represents the original variables:
  
  For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
